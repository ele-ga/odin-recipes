# odin-recipes
First project for Odin Project: creating a recipe website in HTML
Practice for writing HTML boilerplate, using the appropriate tags and elements, creating lists.

Edit: the hardest thing is staying focused on doing things in the proper order, without forgetting some pieces and have to go back to them later.
